# BUILD IT - Research First, Build Second

**Build IT** was an intensive 5-day online technical event organized by the IT Section of **Micro Club** where teams dove deep into modern protocols, algorithms, and technical concepts. Unlike typical hackathons that focus only on the final product, Build IT emphasized the **"Research first, Build second"** methodology.

Teams were challenged to understand a complex technical concept at a deep level, document it thoroughly, and implement it into a functional application that demonstrates their understanding.

## The Challenge

Each team received a specific technical **theme** (a concept, algorithm, or protocol). The mission was to:

### 1. Research

Understand the assigned protocol or algorithm at a deep technical level — theory, architecture, trade-offs, and real-world use cases.

### 2. Document

Create a comprehensive **README.md** serving as a technical article with concept deep-dives, architecture diagrams, design decisions, and implementation details.

### 3. Build

Implement a real, working application that clearly demonstrates the concept. **Clarity, correctness, and understanding matter most.**

## Event Philosophy

> **Ebniha ida kont rajel**

Build IT was designed to challenge participants beyond surface-level implementation:

- Start with the **concept**, not the UI
- Draw diagrams early
- Ask mentors questions
- Explain things in your own words
- **Simplicity > Overengineering**

Weak understanding results in low scores, no matter how fancy the UI. Every team member must understand the project deeply.
