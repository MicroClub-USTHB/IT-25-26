# 📝 Advanced Task Manager App Challenge

Welcome to the **Advanced Task Manager App Challenge**! This project is designed to **push your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to the next level** by building a fully interactive and dynamic web application from scratch.

Your goal is to create a **Task Manager** where users can organize, track, and manage their tasks efficiently. This challenge will test your ability to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and manage data in the browser.

## 🚀 Challenge Overview

You are tasked with building a **web-based task manager** that allows users to:

- **Add new tasks** with titles and optional categories.
- **Edit tasks** after they are created.
- **Delete tasks** when they are no longer needed.
- **Mark tasks as completed** and visually distinguish completed tasks.
- **Filter tasks** by status (all, completed, pending) and category.
- **Reorder tasks** via drag-and-drop (advanced bonus).
- **Persist tasks** across page reloads using `localStorage`.

This project will make your app **interactive, responsive, and user-friendly** while giving you practical experience with real-world front-end development concepts.
