## How the Web Works

![How a Website Works](images/1690435110How-a-Website-Works.png)

Every time you visit a website, your **browser** (the client) sends a request to a **server** over the internet. The server processes the request and sends back a response — usually an HTML page, JSON data, or a file.

```
Browser (Client)  ──── Request ────▶  Server
                  ◀─── Response ───
```

This back-and-forth conversation is the foundation of everything on the web: loading pages, submitting forms, logging in, and more.

### Key Concepts

- **Client**: The browser or application making the request (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, a mobile app).
- **Server**: The machine that hosts the website or API and processes incoming requests.
- **Network**: The internet infrastructure that carries data between client and server.

---

## HTTP: The Language of the Web

Browsers and servers communicate using **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol). Every interaction follows a simple **request/response** model.

### HTTP Request

When your browser wants something from a server, it sends an HTTP request. Here is what a typical request looks like:

```http
GET /dashboard HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Cookie: session=abc123
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
```

- **Method**: `GET` means "retrieve this resource." Other common methods include `POST` (send data), `PUT` (update), and `DELETE` (remove).
- **Path**: `/dashboard` is the specific resource being requested.
- **Headers**: Metadata like `Host`, `Cookie`, and `User-Agent` provide additional context about the request.

### HTTP Response

The server replies with an HTTP response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Set-Cookie: session=abc123

<html>
  <body>Welcome back!</body>
</html>
```

- **Status Code**: `200 OK` means the request was successful. Other codes include `404 Not Found`, `403 Forbidden`, and `500 Internal Server Error`.
- **Headers**: Metadata like `Content-Type` tells the browser how to interpret the response body.
- **Body**: The actual content — HTML, JSON, images, etc.

### Common HTTP Methods

| Method | Purpose                  |
|--------|--------------------------|
| GET    | Retrieve a resource      |
| POST   | Submit data to a server  |
| PUT    | Update an existing resource |
| DELETE | Remove a resource        |

## Client vs. Server Trust

One of the most important ideas in web security is understanding **who you can trust**.

### Never Trust the Client

Anything that happens in the browser can be seen, modified, or faked by the user. This includes:

- Form fields and hidden inputs
- Cookies and local storage
- JavaScript code running in the browser
- URL parameters and query strings

A user can open browser developer tools and change any of these values before they reach the server.

### The Server Must Validate Everything

Because the client cannot be trusted, the **server** is responsible for checking and validating all incoming data. This means:

- Verifying that the user is authenticated and authorized
- Validating the format and content of all input
- Not relying on client-side checks alone for security

> **Rule of thumb:** Client-side checks improve user experience. Server-side checks enforce security.

---

## How Web Attacks Happen

Web attacks generally exploit a gap between **what the developer assumed** and **what an attacker actually sends**.

Here is the typical pattern:

1. A web application accepts input from a user (form data, URL parameters, cookies, headers).
2. The application processes that input without proper validation or sanitization.
3. An attacker crafts unexpected input that causes the application to behave in unintended ways.

Most vulnerabilities are not about breaking encryption or bypassing firewalls. They are about **tricking the application** into doing something it was not designed to do, by manipulating the normal request/response flow.

## Common Web Vulnerability Categories

![Top Ten OWASP Web Application Security Vulnerabilities](images/Top-ten-OWASP-Web-Application-Security-Vulnerabilities.png)

Here are some of the most frequently encountered categories of web vulnerabilities. Understanding these at a conceptual level is the first step toward learning how to prevent them.

### Injection

Injection happens when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter (like a database or operating system) as part of a command or query. If the application does not properly separate user input from instructions, an attacker can alter the intended logic.

### Broken Authentication

Authentication flaws allow attackers to compromise passwords, session tokens, or other credentials. This can let an attacker impersonate a legitimate user.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS occurs when an application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation. This can allow an attacker to execute scripts in another user's browser, potentially stealing session data or redirecting the user.

### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

IDOR happens when an application exposes internal objects (like database IDs or file paths) and does not verify that the requesting user is authorized to access them. An attacker can simply change a parameter to access another user's data.

### Security Misconfiguration

This covers a broad range of issues: default credentials, unnecessary services enabled, overly permissive settings, or verbose error messages that leak information about the application's internals.

### Sensitive Data Exposure

Applications sometimes fail to adequately protect sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information — whether in transit (over the network) or at rest (in storage).

## Introduction to Burp Suite

![Burp Suite](images/burp.svg)

**Burp Suite** is one of the most widely used tools for web security testing. It acts as a **proxy** — it sits between your browser and the server, allowing you to inspect, modify, and replay HTTP requests and responses.

### Why Use Burp Suite?

- **Intercept traffic**: See exactly what your browser sends and what the server returns.
- **Modify requests**: Change parameters, headers, or cookies before they reach the server to test how the application responds.
- **Replay requests**: Resend modified requests without having to interact with the browser each time.
- **Scan for vulnerabilities**: Burp Suite includes automated scanning tools that can identify common security issues.

### How It Works

```
Browser  ──▶  Burp Suite (Proxy)  ──▶  Server
         ◀──                      ◀──
```

Instead of your browser talking directly to the server, Burp Suite intercepts the traffic in both directions. You can pause, inspect, and modify any request or response before it continues on its way.

### Key Burp Suite Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Proxy     | Intercepts and displays HTTP traffic between browser and server |
| Repeater  | Lets you manually modify and resend individual requests |
| Intruder  | Automates sending many variations of a request for testing |
| Decoder   | Encodes and decodes data in various formats |

Burp Suite is a powerful learning tool. By watching real HTTP traffic, you develop a much deeper understanding of how web applications work — and where things can go wrong.

---

## Summary

| Topic | Key Takeaway |
|-------|-------------|
| How the web works | Browsers send requests; servers send responses |
| HTTP | A structured text protocol with methods, headers, and status codes |
| Client vs. server trust | Never trust the client; always validate on the server |
| How attacks happen | Attackers send unexpected input that the application processes unsafely |
| Vulnerability categories | Injection, XSS, IDOR, broken auth, misconfiguration, data exposure |
| Burp Suite | A proxy tool for inspecting and modifying HTTP traffic |

## Browser Developer Tools

Modern browsers come with built-in **developer tools** (often called *DevTools*) that are extremely useful for understanding how web applications work — and how they can be attacked.

You can usually open them with:
- `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows / Linux)
- Right click → *Inspect*

These tools allow you to inspect and manipulate what happens inside the browser in real time.

---

### Why Developer Tools Matter for Web Security

Before using advanced tools like Burp Suite, it is essential to understand what the browser itself can already show you.

With developer tools, you can:
- Inspect HTML and JavaScript code
- Modify page content locally
- View and edit cookies and storage
- Observe network requests and responses
- Debug client-side logic

This helps you understand **what data is controlled by the client** and why it cannot be trusted.

---

### Important DevTools Panels

#### Elements Panel
- Shows the page’s HTML and CSS
- Allows you to modify the DOM locally
- Demonstrates that client-side restrictions can be bypassed easily

This is useful for understanding why hiding elements or buttons is **not a security control**.

---

#### Console Panel
- Executes JavaScript in the context of the page
- Displays errors and logs
- Allows interaction with client-side variables and functions

Attackers often use the console to test assumptions and manipulate application behavior.

---

#### Network Panel
- Displays all HTTP requests made by the page
- Shows request methods, headers, cookies, parameters, and responses
- Helps visualize the request/response flow without any external tools

This panel is an excellent bridge between theory and tools like Burp Suite.

---

#### Storage / Application Panel
- Displays cookies, local storage, and session storage
- Allows manual editing of stored values
- Shows how authentication and session data is stored client-side

This reinforces the idea that **anything stored in the browser is user-controlled**.

---

### Developer Tools vs Burp Suite

| Developer Tools | Burp Suite |
|-----------------|------------|
| Built into the browser | External proxy tool |
| Passive inspection | Active interception & modification |
| Limited automation | Advanced testing & automation |
| Great for learning | Essential for professional testing |

Developer tools help you **understand** what is happening.  
Burp Suite helps you **manipulate and test** it.

---

### Key Takeaway

Browser developer tools are the first step into web security.

If you understand:
- what the browser sends
- what the server receives
- what data the user controls

then tools like Burp Suite become much easier — and much more powerful.

## Cookies and Client-Side Storage

Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the browser and sent automatically with HTTP requests to a server.
They are commonly used to manage **authentication**, **sessions**, and **user state**.

From a security perspective, cookies are one of the most important concepts to understand.

---

### What Cookies Are Used For

Common uses of cookies include:
- Session identifiers after login
- Remembering user preferences
- Tracking user activity
- Maintaining authentication state

A typical cookie looks like this:

```http
Set-Cookie: session=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax



## Next Steps

- Set up Burp Suite and explore HTTP traffic from your own browser.
- Learn about the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) — the industry-standard list of critical web security risks.
- Practice in safe, legal environments like [OWASP WebGoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/) or [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).
